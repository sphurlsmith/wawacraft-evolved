# Wawacraft: Evolved

Wawacraft:Evolved is a 3D voxel-based survival-sandbox game programmed in C++ and 
OpenGL with a goal of creating a technically & artistically impressive sequel to 
the original game: Wawacraft(or how I like to refer to it as of now, due to its 
age: Wawacraft Classic). It is also - much like its predecessor - a game with a focus 
on Earless cats.

Playable characters will include: Wawa, Uni, Floppa, and Ploobie.

The game is intended to have an offbeat crafting system, a charm system, RPG elements 
such as special skills and levels, multiple bosses to play through, and even the idea 
of LAN multiplayer, or global multiplayer over the Internet?

Wawacraft:Evolved is a game that remains in progress, with its initial development 
beginning since around the beginning of August circa 15/8/24 . 

The original game Wawacraft Classic is available in its latest distribution flavour, 
Lockhart and Tuxhart for Windows and Linux respectively.
