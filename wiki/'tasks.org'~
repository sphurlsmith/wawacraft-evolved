* Pending Tasks
* Wiki Documentation

** Start

This document details some of the pending tasks that the project must oversee. It also contains a
section documenting some notes that I wouldnt put in the journal. It is organized into time-specific
tasks and more general tasks(i.e. milestones).

** Organization

They are organized within the [[Practical Documentation]] section of this document. There are two
sections in that area:

1. [[Immediate tasks]] A list of TODOs for the project, things that need doing.
2. [[Milestones]]      A milestone to reach for the project in general, such as pushing the release
                   stage or some other thing.

**** DONE Create a working shader class
>> This task was finished when I saved myself weeks of headaches by using
   *std::string* instead of *const char**. It would be possible to use C-strings
   for code cleanliness but I'd rather have it be ugly and memory safe
   rather than beautiful and memory unsafe.

**** TODO Create a working mesh class
>> This task requires a list of things and that is

:LIST:
1. To decide how the architecture of rendering must go.
   If I was to choose the functional/procedural approach, I
   would make the code architecture
