* Welcome to the Wawacraft:Evolved Development Wiki!
** Introduction

The Wawacraft:Evolved Development Wiki[or simply referred to as the WCEV Wiki or WCEVDW] is a
project aimed at documenting the development of Wawacraft:Evolved, and documenting the game
itself within all aspects, both in for the game's art, music, story, characters, lore, game code and
much more.

This is the main page of the wiki, which is why it is respectively titled INDEX. Consider the menu
of pages that you can head to under this page, titled the [[Table of Contents]].
