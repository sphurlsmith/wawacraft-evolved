Wawa is by far the most popular character in the game of Wawacraft:Evolved, as well as its
predecessor, Wawacraft, and any other future media featuring him.

He is commonly depicted as an earless cat with 2 crimson blotches about his sides, with his left
blotch being significantly smaller than his right, and both of them usually not meeting. The rest of
his fur is white. He is usually also depicted with a hammer as his tool.

    - Altruistic sawg :: He values others before he values himself, and is charismatic

**** History

Wawa is based off of a meme edit that went significantly popular on the internet around 2022 called
Wawa or by the better recognised name, Oh The Misery(not to be confused with the boss, also named Oh
The Misery, or for differentiation, OTM).
